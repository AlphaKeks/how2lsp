# how2lsp

This is meant as a base for you to start configuring Treesitter, LSP and nvim-cmp for neovim. It's
not meant to "just work" but rather to explain the basics and give you a push into the right
direction if you want to learn more. Always read the friendly manual (`:h`) and look at plugin
documentation. Don't expect anything to "just work" -- (neo)vim is about configuring and making it
your own. If you're not willing to put in any effort, use VSCode.
